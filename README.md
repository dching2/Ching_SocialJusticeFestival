# Title
Denny Ching Social Justice Festival

# Project Overview

A topic that I wanted to cover and have a deep connection to is stopping hate towards Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI).
Addressing the urgent problem of putting an end to hate crimes and discrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) is essential in light of the growing number of such instances. The who in this narrative involves not only the AAPI community but also allies and advocates from diverse backgrounds who recognize the urgency of dismantling stereotypes and prejudices. Not only the well-being of individuals is in question, but also the essential foundations of our society are at risk. Hate towards the AAPI community manifests in various forms, from microaggressions to violent attacks. Understanding the complexity of this issue requires acknowledging historical context, systemic biases, and the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes.

The why of stopping hate towards Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders is rooted in the fundamental principles of justice, equality, and human dignity. Creating a society that celebrates its diverse mix and says no to discrimination happens when we encourage an environment that appreciates differences. Additionally, addressing hate towards the AAPI community is a step towards a more united and harmonious society where individuals can thrive without fear of prejudice. This commitment extends beyond specific places and times, requiring continuous incorporation into our daily lives.

Together We Stand is an idea that I have for a festival that expand for 3 days. Within those 3 days different events are talking place. First day would be a panel discussion. The second day centers around interactive workshops like self defense and martial art. Finally, the third day centers around art making and calligraphy. "Together We Stand" aims to foster understanding, appreciation, and solidarity among attendees, creating a memorable and impactful three-day experience.
